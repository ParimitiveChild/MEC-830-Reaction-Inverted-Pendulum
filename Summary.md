# MEC-830-Reaction-Inverted-Pendulum
This regards to a project done for MEC 830 - Mechatronics Design. The aim was to balance an inverted pendulum.

In order to balance the pendulum the idea was to use a reaction wheel.

Initially, the motor used was a standard brushed DC micro-motor. Due to time limitations, it was not possible to buy a different motor.
  This motor was found to be insufficient in torque.

A second attempt using a brushless drone motor was made. Although much better in performance, it still lacked the necessary torque to balance the pendulum.
